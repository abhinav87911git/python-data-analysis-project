This is a python data analysis project. In this project I did analysis of dataset containing the Diwali Sales data.
Firstly, I performed basic data cleaning and formatting on the dataset and then performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the data.
I used various functions, operations and calculations to find out the important information from this data.
For these calculations and operations I used the libraries like : NumPy and Pandas.
For visualizing the important stats and insights I used libraries like : Matplotlib and Seaborn.
